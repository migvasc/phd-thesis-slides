abstract="The use of renewable energy is a major trend to meet datacenters energy needs. However, its intermittent nature requires energy storage devices to store the over produced energy when not being used. Thus, the green coverage value, representing the fraction of total energy consumption covered by renewable energy, is increased. In this paper, we analyze the impact of using different battery sizes to optimize renewable energy usage. We have built a battery simulation tool able to provide the battery state, track the amount of stored and used energy by the battery as a function of the energy consumed by a datacenter and the energy produced by solar panels. We show the impact of battery size on the green coverage percentage, green energy loss, and brown energy taken from the traditional grid. A comparison of these metrics is made for three different geographical locations at 10{\$}{\$}^{\{}{\backslash}circ {\}}{\$}{\$}∘, 35{\$}{\$}^{\{}{\backslash}circ {\}}{\$}{\$}∘, and 60{\$}{\$}^{\{}{\backslash}circ {\}}{\$}{\$}∘latitude. We discuss the competitiveness of constructing datacenters in different geographical locations based on the results.",

abstract = {The theory of deterministic sequencing and scheduling has expanded rapidly during the past years. In this paper we survey the state of the art with respect to optimization and approximation algorithms and interpret these in terms of computational complexity theory. Special cases considered are single machine scheduling, identical, uniform and unrelated parallel machine scheduling, and open shop, flow shop and job shop scheduling. We indicate some problems for future research and include a selective bibliography.}
